            <p>
                Since I was little, Iâ€™ve loved gardening because my grandpa always showed me how to do it.
                Over the years, Iâ€™ve planted and grown all kinds of herbs,fruits and vegetables.
                Two years ago, I planted a pineapple head, and at the beginning of this year, we finally got to eat itâ€”yes, we waited two years for it to grow but it was so sweet and delicious &#127821;.
                I would say that I have green fingers.
                There's something incredibly satisfying about growing a plant from seed to harvest. Each time I see a sprout emerge from the soil, it feels like a little victory.

                I absolutely love trying different foods and desserts! Whenever I have the chance to taste something new, I canâ€™t help but feel excited.
                Discovering new restaurants and desserts feels like a fun adventure, and I enjoy exploring all the different flavors out there.
                Each new dish is a surprise, and I love the thrill of finding a hidden gem or a unique dessert that I've never had before.
                Every bite brings me joy, and Iâ€™m always looking forward to my next tasty experience.

            <p>

                Iâ€™ve always had a passion for art; thereâ€™s something incredibly fulfilling about shutting out the world and focusing entirely on a simple project.
                Recently, Iâ€™ve developed a keen interest in 3D art, which has become a delightful challenge.
                While it takes a lot of time to complete something three-dimensional, I find it surprisingly relaxing.
                Each project becomes a journey, and I love the sense of accomplishment that comes with completing something.
