I would characterize their audio aura as purple (which represents a listener that tunes in to get amped up, entertained, and moving ) and orange(which represents their need for high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds) as most of the songs energy is above 0.7.
As supposed in the specification Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a personâ€™s top 100 songs from the past year, that is just basing the aura on all the songs.
I think that it should be based on the top 10 only as they are the most listened through the year ,which would give a more specific aura audio.
I would suggested they find the average of energy, valence, and danceability of their top 10 songs.
